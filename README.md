# Panopticon

A weekly goal-tracking web app that gamifies self-improvement through social accountability. Users set recurring and one-off weekly goals, track completion, and share progress publicly — creating motivation through visibility.

Named after Bentham's "all-seeing" prison design: the awareness of being observed drives self-regulation.

**Core insight:** Changes publish at a user-configured time (default: midnight local) so users are protected from revealing exactly *when* they worked on things.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (for Postgres) or a native Postgres 17 install
- Node.js 20+ and npm

### 1. Install Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### 2. Start Postgres

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Configure the API

```bash
cp api/.env.example api/.env
```

Open `api/.env` and fill in:

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Same as above |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | `openssl rand -base64 64` |

The redirect URI registered in Google Cloud Console must match `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` (default: `http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback`).

### 4. Run the API

Migrations run automatically on startup.

```bash
cd api
cargo run
```

### 5. Run the scheduler (separate terminal)

The scheduler polls every 60 seconds for pending publish-queue entries and flips them to published.

```bash
cd api
cargo run --bin scheduler
```

### 6. Configure and run the frontend

```bash
cp web/.env.local.example web/.env.local
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How it works

### Publish cycle

Progress updates are **private until your configured publish time** (default: midnight in your timezone). When you log progress, a row is written to the `publish_queue` table with a `scheduled_publish_at` timestamp. The scheduler daemon runs every 60 seconds, finds due entries, and flips `is_published = true` on the corresponding `weekly_progress` rows. Followers only ever see published snapshots.

### Goals

- **Recurring goals** carry forward automatically week over week. Archive them to stop.
- **Weekly goals** are one-off goals tied to a specific week. They expire after their week ends.

### Week boundaries

Each user configures their own week start day (Sunday through Saturday — any day of the week). All week calculations derive from `users.week_start` at query time.

### Social

Follows are unidirectional (Strava-style) — no approval needed. The feed shows published weekly activity from users you follow. The leaderboard is opt-in and ranks by streak (consecutive weeks at ≥80% completion) and consistency, not raw percentage.

DELETE /notes/:id                   Delete note

POST   /follows/:user_id            Follow a user
DELETE /follows/:user_id            Unfollow

GET    /leaderboard                 Opt-in leaderboard
POST   /leaderboard/opt-in          Join leaderboard
DELETE /leaderboard/opt-in          Leave leaderboard
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests (backend)
cd api && cargo test

# Type-check (frontend)
cd web && npx tsc --noEmit

# Build for production (frontend)
cd web && npm run build
```

### SQLx offline mode

If you need to compile the API without a running database (e.g. in CI), generate the offline query cache first:

```bash
cd api
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres
cargo sqlx prepare
```

Then set `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` when building.
